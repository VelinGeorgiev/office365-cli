## Remarks:

To list available tabs in a specific Microsoft Teams channel, you have to first log in to the Microsoft Graph using the [graph login](../login.md)command, eg. `graph login`.

You can only see the tab list of a team you are a member of.

The tabs Conversations and Files are present in every team and therefore not provided as a tab in the response from the graph call.

## Examples:
  
List all tabs in a Microsoft Teams channel

```sh
graph teams tab list --teamId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --channelId 19:00000000000000000000000000000000@thread.skype
```
    
Include all the values from the tab configuration and associated teams app

```sh
graph teams tab list --teamId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --channelId 19:00000000000000000000000000000000@thread.skype --output json
```
